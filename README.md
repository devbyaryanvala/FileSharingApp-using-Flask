---

## Technologies Used
This project is built using a combination of technologies for both its backend and frontend:

* **Backend**: üêç **Python** (41.7%) with the **Flask** framework. Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework, ideal for building web services and applications quickly.
* **Frontend**:
    * üìÑ **HTML** (38.5%): Used for structuring the web pages and creating the user interface.
    * üé® **CSS** (19.8%): Applied for styling the HTML elements, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design.

## Setup and Local Execution (General Guidance)

**Please Note**: Specific, detailed instructions on how to set up and run *this particular* `FileSharingApp-using-Flask` project locally are currently not available in the repository or through external searches. The following are general steps commonly required for Flask applications. You may need to examine the project's source code for precise configurations and dependencies.

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    Begin by cloning the project from its GitHub repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/devbyaryanvala/FileSharingApp-using-Flask.git](https://github.com/devbyaryanvala/FileSharingApp-using-Flask.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    Change your current working directory to the newly cloned project folder.
    ```bash
    cd FileSharingApp-using-Flask
    ```

3.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**:
    It's best practice to create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies separately.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4.  **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
    * **On Windows**:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **On macOS/Linux**:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

5.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Most Flask applications list their dependencies in a `requirements.txt` file. If present, install them using pip.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(If `requirements.txt` is not found, you'll need to manually install Flask: `pip install Flask`.)*

6.  **Set Flask Environment Variables**:
    You often need to tell Flask where your application file is.
    ```bash
    # On Windows
    set FLASK_APP=app.py  # Or your main Flask application file
    # On macOS/Linux
    export FLASK_APP=app.py # Or your main Flask application file
    ```

7.  **Run the Flask Application**:
    Once the dependencies are installed and the `FLASK_APP` variable is set, you can run the application.
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

8.  **Access the Application**:
    After the server starts, you can typically access the application in your web browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
